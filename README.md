### Hello, I'm Yunus. ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm interested in web development and I enjoy that. In line with this area, I train myself by developing with Javascript and Ruby on Rails. I also use GNU/Linux operating systems and develop myself on these systems. I adopt the Free Software Philosophy and try to support it as much as I can.
